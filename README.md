Which Home Credit customers are most likely to pay off their loans?

Business Problem Statement
People with bad or no credit have a difficult time getting a personal, home, or business loan. For folks who do want a loan, they are often preyed upon by lenders who push exorbitant fees and annual percentage rates. 
Home Credit hopes to solve this problem by targeting their business model on customers who have bad or no credit history without using predatory lending practices. To do this, Home Credit needs to find a way to predict how capable each applicant is with loan payments. 
For this project, we can build a classification model to categorize and predict which customers are most likely to pay off their loans. That information can then be used to supplement a risk model for approving loans to customers or for more focused marketing campaigns.
The project deliverable will be a list of customers that would be deemed likely to pay off their loans. Any additional deliverables will be discussed and decided amongst our group and our professors. We will have a draft of our report by March 28th, 2023, with a final deliverable of our report on April 18th, 2023.
