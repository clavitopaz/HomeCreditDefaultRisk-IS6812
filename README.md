Exploratory Data Analysis and Modeling for Home Credit Capstone Project

# Home Credit EDA: Results Overview
- Identified predictive power in customer data that is 'NA'. However, we removed the normalized housing data as there was too many NA fields in their columns, and we may not be able to extract any useful information from that data if we find any correlations.

- In reviewing the number and percentage of contracts for each customer by contract type, family status, car ownership, etc., we got a better idea of the makeup of our customer base. It seems that customers with trouble paying off their loan (in majority) own realty, make on average $160,000, are married and have no children. 

- We've made note to not explore gender as a predictive power for our project. Note - we have more women customers than men!

- If I had more time, I would have segmented the normalized housing dataset for all non-"NA" fields. It would have been interesting to see if there were any stark differences from that dataset to the one we explored in this assignment. 

- This EDA project has gotten me to feel more comfortable in using R. I have been able to create my own plots andI've pivoted and mutated many data tables. This also has given me more appreciation for performing EDA for a project - as it provides the user value in understanding the dataset before executing a project.
